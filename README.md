# What is in the weather repository?

This repository contains data from the National Centers for Environmental Information (https://www.climate.gov/maps-data/dataset/past-weather-zip-code-data-table).

Using this data, weather visualizations are done for a zipcode to answer the following questions:
* When is the average first freeze in the fall?
* When is the average latest freeze in the spring?
* How often has it rained?
* Which months receive more (or less) rain?
* How often has it snowed?


# Why/History

These visualizations are helpful for gardeners and/or farmers that pay attention to precipitation and freezing temperatures.  The visualizations may also be helpful for real estate / finding new areas with which one is not as familiar.

# How do I run the code?

If you have cloned the repository:
* Run 'Yearly first and last freeze.R' with temperature data.
* Run 'Precipitation.Rmd' with RStudio on the precipidation data.
